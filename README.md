Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
Project Overview:

Customer Segmentation is an unsupervised machine learning project that groups customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses understand customer patterns and design targeted marketing strategies.

Objective:

To segment customers into meaningful groups such as:

High Spenders

Budget Customers

Average Shoppers

using purchasing-related features.

Problem Type:

Unsupervised Machine Learning – Clustering

Dataset:

Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle)

Records: 200 customers

Features used:

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

Techniques & Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering (conceptual understanding)

Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection

Project Workflow:

Load and explore customer data

Select relevant features for clustering

Scale features for distance-based algorithms

Apply Elbow Method to find optimal clusters

Perform K-Means clustering

Visualize customer segments

Interpret cluster characteristics

Visualizations:

Elbow Curve to determine optimal number of clusters

2D Scatter Plot to visualize customer segments

Tools & Technologies:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Results:

Customers were successfully segmented into distinct groups based on income and spending behavior, enabling insights such as identifying high-value customers and low-engagement customers.
